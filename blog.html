                <h2># Difference between local storage and session storage.</h2>
                <p>SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                    expire,
                    data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                    particular
                    tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h2># Difference between global scope and block scope.</h2>
                <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
                    controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.

                <h2># How event loop works in javascript.</h2>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h2># Datatype: undefined
                </h2>
                <p>* A variable in JavaScript that is without any value has a value of undefined. The datatype of a
                    variable that holds an undefined value is also 'undefined'.
                    <br>* You can also empty an existing variable that has some existing value by setting its value as
                    undefined.
                    <br> * You should know that an empty string is different from an undefined value!
